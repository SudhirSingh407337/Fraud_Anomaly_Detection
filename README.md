# Fraud Detection with Anomaly Detection

This project demonstrates fraud detection in credit card transactions using unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, including Autoencoders, Isolation Forests, and Ensemble methods. The workflow is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
